# Amazon Reviews Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing Amazon product reviews data to gain insights into user behavior and product popularity. We'll perform data preparation, identify frequent viewers, and explore the behavior of both frequent and non-frequent viewers.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Id**
- **ProductId**: Unique identifier for the product.
- **UserId**: Unique identifier for the user.
- **ProfileName**
- **HelpfulnessNumerator**: Number of users who found the review helpful.
- **HelpfulnessDenominator**: Number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful or not.
- **Score**: Rating between 1 and 5.
- **Time**: Timestamp for the review.
- **Summary**: A brief summary of the review.
- **Text**: The text of the review.

## Data Preparation

We start by reading data from an SQLite database, ensuring we have a clean and relevant dataset.

- Check for duplicates and invalid rows.
- Convert the "Time" feature data type to a datetime format.
- Handle outliers and missing values as needed.

## Analyzing User Behavior

### Recommending More Products

To understand which users Amazon can recommend more products to, we analyze user behavior based on the following factors:

- Number of summaries written.
- Number of text reviews.
- Average score given.
- Number of products purchased.

We identify the top users Amazon can recommend more products to based on these factors.

### Identifying Popular Products

We determine which products have a good number of reviews by considering products sold at least 500 times.

### Frequent vs. Non-Frequent Viewers

We classify users into "Frequent" and "Not Frequent" viewers based on the number of products they've bought (threshold: 50 or more). We then explore the behavior of both groups.

- Analyze the distribution of scores given by frequent viewers.
- Compare the behavior of frequent and non-frequent viewers.

## Conclusion

This data analysis provides valuable insights into user behavior, product popularity, and the differences between frequent and non-frequent viewers. The findings can inform recommendations and strategies for Amazon.
